/*Write a program called MathsOps. Take in two integer values from the user; 
store in num1 and num2. Using “good” variable names/indentation, 
 calculate the sum, product, difference and quotient of the two numbers. 
 Output your results. In the format: The sum of 3 and 5 is 8
  (assuming 3 and 5 are typed in). Ensure that you do not divide by 0 
  (as this will cause an exception i.e. a runtime error)*/
